# Discovery of Previously Unknown Geoglyphs and Settlement Patterns in Acre, Brazil

This repository contains the full implementation of my solo submission for the **OpenAI to Z Challenge** ‚Äî a global hackathon focused on uncovering archaeological features in the Amazon Rainforest using AI, satellite imagery, and LIDAR data.

## üß≠ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify and document previously unknown **geoglyphs**, **settlement patterns**, and **archaeological structures** in the **Acre region of Brazil**, an area historically rich in Indigenous activity. Using open-source geospatial data and AI-assisted techniques, this project aimed to uncover remnants hidden beneath the Amazon canopy.
